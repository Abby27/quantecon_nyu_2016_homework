    "Note that we could have a multidimensional state space (i.e. several variables) but the way I am going to design the script is as if we have a vector of states. Then, we would have to consider the joint states as one entry of the vector. For example, if we have two state variables (a vector of values for each state variable), the kronecker product of the vectors would give me a new vector of joint states. In this way, I can reduce the dimensions of the problem, and the transition probability matrix is just two-dimensional."
